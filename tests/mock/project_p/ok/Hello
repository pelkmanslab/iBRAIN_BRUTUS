Hi, I am an "ok iBRAIN" interface.

You can ask me about your project and I can help you to control and monitor it
better.

TIP: you can start with creating an empty file saying help.

  cd ok
  touch help

Other examples are:

  cd ok
  echo list_jobs > help

iBRAIN will respond by creating a file called "ok_help" providing more info.

More examples:

You can try another command:

  cd ok
  touch list_jobs

iBRAIN will respond by creating a file called ok_job_list containing info about
currently running jobs for this project.
