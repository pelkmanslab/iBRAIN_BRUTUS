 iBrain
 ======

iBRAiN is an acronym for image-Based RNAi and was developed as a middle ware
between image analysis software, content management of siRNA libraries, the
storage of large sets of microscopy images, the distribution of computation
jobs on large computer clusters, and the harvesting and visualization of
obtained results. It contains numerous meta-information on genes and proteins,
obtained from ontology databases and STRING. It also incorporates probabilistic
algorithms to determine the true loss-of-function phenotype of a gene from
measurements of multiple siRNAs targeting the same gene. Some of these
algorithms have been developed by us, and will be published in the near future.
iBRAIN also provides a webbrowser-compatible user interface with which the
progress in computational analysis can be easily monitored for each running
project.
