# iBRAIN_BRUTUS
**This repository is for iBRAIN on BRUTUS infrastructure.** It is the *old* iBRAIN.

Code for the new iBRAIN, that will become operational on UZH's Hobbes, is found in the [iBRAIN_UZH](https://github.com/pelkmanslab/iBRAIN_UZH) repository.

This repository was originally extracted from iBRAIN on BRUTUS on Apr 20th 2015.

Changes are **strongly discouraged** apart from necessary bugfixes.

A check-out of this repository is used to run iBRAIN on BRUTUS. Please make sure this is kept synchronized with this repository.

Note that several other respositories are dependencies: [CellProfilerPelkmans](https://github.com/pelkmanslab/CellProfilerPelkmans) and [iBRAINShared](https://github.com/pelkmanslab/iBRAINShared). They are shared with [iBRAIN_UZH](https://github.com/pelkmanslab/iBRAIN_UZH).
