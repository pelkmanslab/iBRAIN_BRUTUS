% Help for the Rename Or Renumber Files module:
% Category: File Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Renames or renumbers files on the hard drive.
% *************************************************************************
%
% File renaming utility that deletes or adds text anywhere within image
% file names. It is especially useful as a file renumbering utility that
% converts numbers within image file names to solve improper ordering of
% files on Unix/Mac OSX systems.  
%
% The settings ask the user to indicate how many characters to retain at
% the beginning and end of each filename. These are the characters that
% will remain unchanged. The user may choose to add text or numbers between
% the characters that are to be retained.
%
% Be very careful since you will be renaming (= overwriting) your files!!
% You will have the opportunity to confirm the name change for the first
% cycle only. The folder containing the files must not contain subfolders
% or the subfolders and their contents will also be renamed. It is worth
% doing a practice run with copies of images first.
%
% Examples:
% 
% Renumber:
% DrosDAPI_1.tif    -> DrosDAPI_001.tif
% DrosDAPI_10.tif   -> DrosDAPI_010.tif
% DrosDAPI_100.tif  -> DrosDAPI_100.tif
% (to accomplish this, retain 4 characters at the end, retain 9 characters
% at the beginning, and use 3 numerical digits between).
%
% Rename:
% 1DrosophilaDAPI_1.tif    -> 1DrosDP_1.tif
% 2DrosophilaDAPI_10.tif   -> 2DrosDP_10.tif
% 3DrosophilaDAPI_100.tif  -> 3DrosDP_100.tif
% (to accomplish this, retain 4 characters at the end, retain 5 characters
% at the beginning, enter "DP" as text to place between, and leave
% numerical digits as is).
