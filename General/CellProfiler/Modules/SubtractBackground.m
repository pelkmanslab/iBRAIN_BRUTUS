function handles = SubtractBackground(handles)

% Help for the Subtract Background module:
% Category: Image Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Calculates the minimum pixel intensity value for the entire set of images
% and subtracts this value from every pixel in every image.
% *************************************************************************
%
% Note that this is not an illumination correction module. It subtracts a
% single value from every pixel across the image.
%
% The intensity due to camera or illumination or antibody background
% (intensity where no cells are sitting) can in good conscience be
% subtracted from the images, but it must be subtracted from every pixel,
% not just the pixels where cells actually are sitting.  This is because we
% assume that this staining is additive with real staining. This module
% calculates the lowest possible pixel intensity across the entire image
% set and subtracts this background value from every pixel in every image.
% This module is identical to the Apply Threshold module (in shift mode),
% except in the SubtractBackground module, the threshold is automatically
% calculated as the 10th lowest pixel value. This will not push any values
% below zero (therefore, we aren't losing any information). It moves the
% baseline up and looks prettier (improves signal to noise) without any
% 'ethical' concerns.
%
% If images have already been quantified and you want to apply the concept
% of this module without reprocessing your images, then multiply the
% background threshold calculated by this module during the first image 
% cycle by the number of pixels in the image to get the number that should 
% be subtracted from the intensity measurements.
%
% If you want to run this module only to calculate the proper threshold to
% use, simply run the module as usual and use the button on the Status
% window to stop processing after the first image cycle.
%
% How it works:
% Sort each image's pixel values and pick the 10th lowest pixel value as
% the minimum. Typical images have a million pixels. The lowest pixel value
% is chosen because it might be zero if it is a stuck pixel. It is quite
% certain that there will not be 10 stuck pixels so this should be safe. 
% Then, take the minimum of these values from all the images. This scalar 
% value should be subtracted from every pixel in the image. CellProfiler is
% not calculating a different value for each pixel position in the image 
% because in a small image set, that position may always be occupied by 
% real staining.
