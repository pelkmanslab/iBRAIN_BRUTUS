% Help for the Crop module:
% Category: Image Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Crops images into a rectangle, ellipse, an arbitrary shape provided by
% the user, a shape identified by an identify module, or a shape used at a
% previous step in the pipeline on another image.
% *************************************************************************
%
% Warnings about this module: The cropping module will remove rows and
% columns that are completely blank. Also, keep in mind that cropping
% changes the size of your images, which may have unexpected consequences.
% For example, identifying objects in a cropped image and then trying to
% measure their intensity in the *original* image will not work because the
% two images are not the same size.
%
% Settings:
%
% Shape:
% Rectangle - self-explanatory.
% Ellipse - self-explanatory.
% Other...
% To crop based on an object identified in a previous module, type in the
% name of that identified object instead of Rectangle or Ellipse. Please
% see PlateFix for information on cropping based on previously identified
% plates.
% To crop into an arbitrary shape you define, use the LoadSingleImage
% module to load a black and white image (that you have already prepared)
% from a file. If you have created this image in an image program such as
% Photoshop, this binary image should contain only the values 0 and 255,
% with zeros (black) for the parts you want to remove and 255 (white) for
% the parts you want to retain. Or, you may have previously generated a
% binary image using this module (e.g. using the ellipse option) and saved
% it using the SaveImages module (see Special note on saving images below).
% In any case, the image must be the exact same starting size as your image
% and should contain a contiguous block of white pixels, because keep in
% mind that the cropping module will remove rows and columns that are
% completely blank.
% To crop into the same shape as was used previously in the pipeline to
% crop another image, type in CroppingPreviousCroppedImageName, where
% PreviousCroppedImageName is the image you produced with the previous Crop
% module.
%
% Coordinate or mouse: For ellipse, you will be asked to click five or more
% points to define an ellipse around the part of the image you want to
% analyze.  Keep in mind that the more points you click, the longer it will
% take to calculate the ellipse shape. For rectangle, you can click as many
% points as you like that are in the interior of the region you wish to
% retain.
%
% PlateFix: To be used only when cropping based on previously identified
% objects. When attempting to crop based on a previously identified object
% (such as a yeast plate), sometimes the identified plate does not have
% precisely straight edges - there might be a tiny, almost unnoticeable
% 'appendage' sticking out of the plate.  Without plate fix, the crop
% module would not crop the image tightly enough - it would include enough
% of the image to retain even the tiny appendage, so there would be a lot
% of blank space around the plate. This can cause problems with later
% modules (especially IlluminationCorrection). PlateFix takes the
% identified object and crops to exclude any minor appendages (technically,
% any horizontal or vertical line where the object covers less than 50% of
% the image). It also sets pixels around the edge of the object (for
% regions > 50% but less than 100%) that otherwise would be zero to the
% background pixel value of your image thus avoiding the problems with
% other modules. Important note >> PlateFix uses the coordinates
% entered in the boxes normally used for rectangle cropping (Top, Left) and
% (Bottom, Right) to tighten the edges around your identified plate. This
% is done because in the majority of plate identifications you do not want
% to include the sides of the plate. If you would like the entire plate to
% be shown, you should enter 1:end for both coordinates. If you would like
% to crop 80 pixels from each edge of the plate, you could enter 80:end-80
% for (Top, Left) and (Bottom, Right).
%
% Special note on saving images: See the help for the SaveImages module.
% Also, you can save the cropping shape that you have used (e.g. an ellipse
% you drew), so that in future analyses you can use the File option. To do
% this, you need to add the prefix "Cropping" to the name you called the
% cropped image (e.g. CroppingCropBlue) and this is the name of the image
% you will want to save using the SaveImages module. I think you will want
% to save it in mat format. You can also save the cropping shape, trimmed
% for any unused rows and columns at the edges. This image has the prefix
% "CropMask" plus the name you called the cropped image (e.g.
% CropMaskCropBlue). This image is used for downstream modules that use
% the CPgraythresh function. The Cropping and CropMask images are similar
% (both are binary and contain the cropping shape you used), but the
% Cropping image is the same size as the original images to be processed
% whereas the CropMask image is the same size as the final, cropped image.
