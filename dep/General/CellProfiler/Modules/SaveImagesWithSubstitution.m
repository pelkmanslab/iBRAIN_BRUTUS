% Help for the Save Images With Substitution module:
% Category: File Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Saves any image produced during the image analysis, in any image format.
% This is a custom version of TS, which allows to replace parts of the
% filename instead of appending to the file name.
% *************************************************************************
%
% Because CellProfiler usually performs many image analysis steps on many
% groups of images, it does *not* save any of the resulting images to the
% hard drive unless you use the SaveImages module to do so. Any of the
% processed images created by CellProfiler during the analysis can be
% saved using this module.
%
% You can choose from among 18 image formats to save your files in. This
% allows you to use the module as a file format converter, by loading files
% in their original format and then saving them in an alternate format.
%
% Please note that this module works for the cases we have tried, but it
% has not been extensively tested, particularly for how it handles color
% images, non-8 bit images, images coming from subdirectories, multiple
% incoming movie files, or filenames made by numerical increments.
%
% Settings:
%
% Update file names within CellProfiler:
% This allows downstream modules (e.g. CreateWebPage) to look up the newly
% saved files on the hard drive. Normally, whatever files are present on
% the hard drive when CellProfiler processing begins (and when the
% LoadImages module processes its first cycle) are the only files that are
% accessible within CellProfiler. This setting allows the newly saved files
% to be accessible to downstream modules. This setting might yield unusual
% consequences if you are using the SaveImages module to save an image
% directly as loaded (e.g. using the SaveImages module to convert file
% formats), because it will, in some places in the output file, overwrite
% the file names of the loaded files with the file names of the the saved
% files. Because this function is rarely needed and may introduce
% complications, the default answer is "No".
%
% Special notes for saving in movie format (avi):
% The movie will be saved after the last cycle is processed. You have the
% option to also save the movie periodically during image processing, so
% that the partial movie will be available in case image processing is
% canceled partway through. Saving movies in avi format is quite slow, so
% you can enter a number to save the movie after every Nth cycle. For
% example, entering a 1 will save the movie after every cycle. When working
% with very large movies, you may also want to save the CellProfiler output
% file every Nth cycle to save time, because the entire movie is stored in
% the output file (this may only be the case if you are working in
% diagnostic mode, see Set Preferences). See the SpeedUpCellProfiler
% module. If you are processing multiple movies, especially movies in
% subdirectories, you should save after every cycle (and also, be aware
% that this module has not been thoroughly tested under those conditions).
% Note also that the movie data is stored in the handles.Pipeline.Movie
% structure of the output file, so you can retrieve the movie data there in
% case image processing is aborted. At the time this module was written,
% MATLAB was only capable of saving in uncompressed avi format (at least on
% the UNIX platform), which is time and space-consuming. You should convert
% the results to a compressed movie format, like .mov using third-party
% software. For suggested third-party software, see the help for the
% LoadImages module.
