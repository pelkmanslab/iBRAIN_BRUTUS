% Help for the Load Single Image module:
% Category: File Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Loads a single image, which will be used for all image cycles.
% *************************************************************************
% Note: for most purposes, you will probably want to use the Load Images
% module, not this one.
%
% Tells CellProfiler where to retrieve a single image and gives the image a
% meaningful name for the other modules to access.  The module only
% functions the first time through the pipeline, and thereafter the image
% is accessible to all subsequent cycles being processed. This is
% particularly useful for loading an image like an Illumination correction
% image to be used by the CorrectIllumination_Apply module. Note: Actually,
% you can load four 'single' images using this module.
%
% Relative pathnames can be used. For example, on the Mac platform you
% could leave the folder where images are to be loaded as '.' to choose the
% default image folder, and then enter ../Imagetobeloaded.tif as the name
% of the file you would like to load in order to load the image from the
% directory one above the default image directory. Or, you could type
% .../AnotherSubfolder (note the three periods: the first is interpreted as
% a standin for the default image folder) as the folder from which images
% are to be loaded and enter the filename as Imagetobeloaded.tif to load an
% image from a different subfolder of the parent of the default image
% folder.
%
% If more than four single images must be loaded, more than one Load Single
% Image module can be run sequentially. Running more than one of these
% modules also allows images to be retrieved from different folders.
%
% LoadImages can now open and read .ZVI files.  .ZVI files are Zeiss files
% that are generated by the microscope imaging software, Axiovision.  These
% images are stored with 12-bit precision.  Currently, this will not work
% with stacked or color images.
%
% See also LoadImages.
