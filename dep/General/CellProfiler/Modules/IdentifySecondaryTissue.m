% Help for the Identify Secondary module:
% Category: Object Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Identifies objects (e.g. cell edges) using "seed" objects identified by
% an Identify Primary module (e.g. nuclei).
% *************************************************************************
%
% This module identifies secondary objects (e.g. cell edges) based on two
% inputs: (1) a previous module's identification of primary objects (e.g.
% nuclei) and (2) an image stained for the secondary objects (not required
% for the Distance - N option). Each primary object is assumed to be completely
% within a secondary object (e.g. nuclei are completely within cells
% stained for actin).
%
% It accomplishes two tasks:
% (a) finding the dividing lines between secondary objects which touch each
% other. Three methods are available: Propagation, Watershed (an older
% version of Propagation), and Distance.
% (b) finding the dividing lines between the secondary objects and the
% background of the image. This is done by thresholding the image stained
% for secondary objects, except when using Distance - N.
%
% Settings:
%
% Methods to identify secondary objects:
% * Propagation - For task (a), this method will find dividing lines
% between clumped objects where the image stained for secondary objects
% shows a change in staining (i.e. either a dimmer or a brighter line).
% Smoother lines work better, but unlike the watershed method, small gaps
% are tolerated. This method is considered an improvement on the
% traditional watershed method. The dividing lines between objects are
% determined by a combination of the distance to the nearest primary object
% and intensity gradients. This algorithm uses local image similarity to
% guide the location of boundaries between cells. Boundaries are
% preferentially placed where the image's local appearance changes
% perpendicularly to the boundary. Reference: TR Jones, AE Carpenter, P
% Golland (2005) Voronoi-Based Segmentation of Cells on Image Manifolds,
% ICCV Workshop on Computer Vision for Biomedical Image Applications, pp.
% 535-543. For task (b), thresholding is used.
%
% * Watershed - For task (a), this method will find dividing lines between
% objects by looking for dim lines between objects. For task (b),
% thresholding is used. Reference: Vincent, Luc, and Pierre Soille,
% "Watersheds in Digital Spaces: An Efficient Algorithm Based on Immersion
% Simulations," IEEE Transactions of Pattern Analysis and Machine
% Intelligence, Vol. 13, No. 6, June 1991, pp. 583-598.
%
% * Distance - This method is bit unusual because the edges of the primary
% objects are expanded a specified distance to create the secondary
% objects. For example, if nuclei are labeled but there is no stain to help
% locate cell edges, the nuclei can simply be expanded in order to estimate
% the cell's location. This is often called the 'doughnut' or 'annulus' or
% 'ring' approach for identifying the cytoplasmic compartment. Using the
% Distance - N method, the image of the secondary staining is not used at
% all, and these expanded objects are the final secondary objects. Using
% the Distance - B method, thresholding is used to eliminate background
% regions from the secondary objects. This allows the extent of the
% secondary objects to be limited to a certain distance away from the edge
% of the primary objects.
%
% Select automatic thresholding method or enter an absolute threshold:
%    The threshold affects the stringency of the lines between the objects
% and the background. See the help for the IdentifyPrimAutomatic module for
% a complete description of the options. Note that Per object options are
% not available for IdentifySecondary because the Per object method relies
% on identifying objects *smaller* than the primary objects, whereas
% secondary objects are always *larger* than their corresponding primary
% objects.
%
% Threshold correction factor:
% When the threshold is calculated automatically, it may consistently be
% too stringent or too lenient. You may need to enter an adjustment factor
% which you empirically determine is suitable for your images. The number 1
% means no adjustment, 0 to 1 makes the threshold more lenient and greater
% than 1 (e.g. 1.3) makes the threshold more stringent. For example, the
% Otsu automatic thresholding inherently assumes that 50% of the image is
% covered by objects. If a larger percentage of the image is covered, the
% Otsu method will give a slightly biased threshold that may have to be
% corrected using a threshold correction factor.
%
% Lower and upper bounds on threshold:
% Can be used as a safety precaution when the threshold is calculated
% automatically. For example, if there are no objects in the field of view,
% the automatic threshold will be unreasonably low. In such cases, the
% lower bound you enter here will override the automatic threshold.
%
% Approximate percentage of image covered by objects:
% An estimate of how much of the image is covered with objects. This
% information is currently only used in the MoG (Mixture of Gaussian)
% thresholding but may be used for other thresholding methods in the future
% (see below).
%
% Regularization factor (for propagation method only):
% This method takes two factors into account when deciding where to draw
% the dividing line between two touching secondary objects: the distance to
% the nearest primary object, and the intensity of the secondary object
% image. The regularization factor controls the balance between these two
% considerations: A value of zero means that the distance to the nearest
% primary object is ignored and the decision is made entirely on the
% intensity gradient between the two competing primary objects. Larger
% values weight the distance between the two values more and more heavily.
% The regularization factor can be infinitely large, but around 10 or so,
% the intensity image is almost completely ignored and the dividing line
% will simply be halfway between the two competing primary objects.
%
% Note: Primary identify modules produce two (hidden) output images that
% are used by this module. The Segmented image contains the final, edited
% primary objects (i.e. objects at the border and those that are too small
% or large have been excluded). The SmallRemovedSegmented image is the
% same except that the objects at the border and the large objects have
% been included. These extra objects are used to perform the identification
% of secondary object outlines, since they are probably real objects (even
% if we don't want to measure them). Small objects are not used at this
% stage because they are more likely to be artifactual, and so they
% therefore should not "claim" any secondary object pixels.
%
% TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROPAGATION OPTION:
% Propagate labels from LABELS_IN to LABELS_OUT, steered by IMAGE and
% limited to MASK. MASK should be a logical array. LAMBDA is a
% regularization parameter, larger being closer to Euclidean distance in
% the image plane, and zero being entirely controlled by IMAGE. Propagation
% of labels is by shortest path to a nonzero label in LABELS_IN. Distance
% is the sum of absolute differences in the image in a 3x3 neighborhood,
% combined with LAMBDA via sqrt(differences^2 + LAMBDA^2). Note that there
% is no separation between adjacent areas with different labels (as there
% would be using, e.g., watershed). Such boundaries must be added in a
% postprocess. IdentifySecPropagateSubfunction is the subfunction
% implemented in C and MEX to perform the propagate algorithm.
%
% IdentifySecPropagateSubfunction.cpp is the source code, in C++
% IdentifySecPropagateSubfunction.dll is compiled for windows
% IdentifySecPropagateSubfunction.mexmac is compiled for macintosh
% IdentifySecPropagateSubfunction.mexglx is compiled for linux
% IdentifySecPropagateSubfunction.mexa64 is compiled for 64-bit linux
%
% To compile IdentifySecPropagateSubfunction for different operating
% systems, you will need to log on to that operating system and at the
% command line of MATLAB enter:
% mex IdentifySecPropagateSubfunction

        %%% the background pixels by computing the SKIZ
        %%% (skeleton of influence zones), which is done by watershedding the
        %%% distance transform of the thresholded image.  These watershed lines are
        %%% then superimposed on the marked image that will be watershedded to
        %%% segment the objects.  I think this would not produce results different
        %%% from METHOD 1 (the one used above), since METHOD 1 overlays the
        %%% outlines of the primary objects anyway.
        %%% This method is based on the Mathworks Image Processing Toolbox demo
        %%% "Marker-Controlled Watershed Segmentation".  I found it online; I don't
        %%% think it is in the Matlab Demos that are found through help.  It uses
        %%% an image of a box of oranges.
        %%%
        %%% METHOD (3):  (I think this method does not work well for clustered
        %%% objects.)  The distance transformed image containing the marked objects
        %%% is watershedded, which produces lines midway between the marked
        %%% objects.  These lines are superimposed on the marked image that will be
        %%% watershedded to segment the objects. But if marked objects are
        %%% clustered and not a uniform distance from each other, this will produce
        %%% background lines on top of actual objects.
        %%% This method is based on Gonzalez, et al. Digital Image Processing using

        %%% STEP 2: Identify the outlines of each primary object, so that each
