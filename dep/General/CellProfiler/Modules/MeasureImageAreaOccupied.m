% Help for the Measure Image Area Occupied module:
% Category: Measurement
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Measures total area covered by stain in an image.
% *************************************************************************
%
% This module simply measures the total area covered by stain in an
% image, using a threshold to determine stain vs background.
%
% How it works:
% This module applies a threshold to the incoming image so that any pixels
% brighter than the specified value are assigned the value 1 (white) and
% the remaining pixels are assigned the value zero (black), producing a
% binary image. The number of white pixels are then counted. This provides
% a measurement of the area occupied by the staining.
%
% Settings:
%
% * Select automatic thresholding method:
%    The threshold affects the stringency of the lines between the
% objects and the background. You can have the threshold automatically
% calculated using several methods, or you can enter an absolute number
% between 0 and 1 for the threshold (to see the pixel intensities for your
% images in the appropriate range of 0 to 1, use the CellProfiler Image
% Tool, 'Show Or Hide Pixel Data', in a window showing your image).
% There are advantages either way.  An absolute number treats every
% image identically, but is not robust to slight changes in
% lighting/staining conditions between images. An automatically
% calculated threshold adapts to changes in lighting/staining
% conditions between images and is usually more robust/accurate, but
% it can occasionally produce a poor threshold for unusual/artifactual
% images. It also takes a short time to calculate.
%    The threshold which is used for each image is recorded as a
% measurement in the output file, so if you find unusual measurements
% from one of your images, you might check whether the automatically
% calculated threshold was unusually high or low compared to the
% other images.
%    There are four methods for finding thresholds automatically, Otsu's
% method, the Mixture of Gaussian (MoG) method, the Background method, and
% the Ridler-Calvard method. The Otsu method uses our version of the Matlab
% function graythresh (the code is in the CellProfiler subfunction
% CPthreshold). Our modifications include taking into account the max and
% min values in the image and log-transforming the image prior to
% calculating the threshold. Otsu's method is probably better if you don't
% know anything about the image, or if the percent of the image covered by
% objects varies substantially from image to image. But if you know the
% object coverage percentage and it does not vary much from image to image,
% the MoG can be better, especially if the coverage percentage is not near
% 50%. Note, however, that the MoG function is experimental and has not
% been thoroughly validated. The background function is very simple and is
% appropriate for images in which most of the image is background. It finds
% the mode of the histogram of the image, which is assumed to be the
% background of the image, and chooses a threshold at twice that value
% (which you can adjust with a Threshold Correction Factor, see below).
% This can be very helpful, for example, if your images vary in overall
% brightness but the objects of interest are always twice (or actually, any
% constant) as bright as the background of the image. The Ridler-Calvard
% method is simple and its results are often very similar to Otsu's. It
% chooses and initial threshold, and then iteratively calculates the next
% one by taking the mean of the average intensities of the background and
% foreground pixels determined by the first threshold, repeating this until
% the threshold converges.
%
% * Threshold correction factor:
% When the threshold is calculated automatically, it may consistently be
% too stringent or too lenient. You may need to enter an adjustment factor
% which you empirically determine is suitable for your images. The number 1
% means no adjustment, 0 to 1 makes the threshold more lenient and greater
% than 1 (e.g. 1.3) makes the threshold more stringent. For example, the
% Otsu automatic thresholding inherently assumes that 50% of the image is
% covered by objects. If a larger percentage of the image is covered, the
% Otsu method will give a slightly biased threshold that may have to be
% corrected using a threshold correction factor.
%
% * Lower and upper bounds on threshold:
% Can be used as a safety precaution when the threshold is calculated
% automatically. For example, if there are no objects in the field of view,
% the automatic threshold will be unreasonably low. In such cases, the
% lower bound you enter here will override the automatic threshold.
%
% * Approximate percentage of image covered by objects:
% An estimate of how much of the image is covered with objects. This
% information is currently only used in the MoG (Mixture of Gaussian)
% thresholding but may be used for other thresholding methods in the
% future.
