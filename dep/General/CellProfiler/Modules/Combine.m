function handles = Combine(handles)

% Help for the Combine module:
% Category: Image Processing
%
% SHORT DESCRIPTION:
% Takes 1 to 3 color or grayscale images and combines them into 1. Each image's
% intensity can be adjusted independently.
% *************************************************************************
%
% This module takes color or grayscale images as inputs, and produces a new one
% which results from the weighted average of the pixel intensities of the
% input images. All the images to be combined must be all either grayscale
% or color.  The average is found by taking the product of each weight
% and the intensity of its corresponding image, adding the products, and
% then dividing the result by the sum of the weights. By taking the
% weighted average of the pixel intensities, the overall intensity of the
% resulting image will remain the same as that of the inputs. If you want
% to change the overall intensity, you should use the Rescale module.
%
% Settings:
%
% Choose the input images: You must select at least two images which you
% would like to combine. They must all be the same size, since the average
% will be taken pixel by pixel.
%
% Weights: The weights will determine how each input image will affect the
% combined one. The higher the weight of an image, the more it will be
% reflected in the combined image. Because of the way the average is taken,
% it only matters how these weights relate to each other (e.g. entering
% weights 0.27, 0.3, and 0.3 is the same as entering weights 0.9, 1, and
% 1). Make sure all the weights have positive values.
